Notes on this Project :
- Kubernetes cluster created using Kubernetes binary v1.6.4, using systemd, installed in Ubuntu 16.04 image from GCE
- Jenkins mounted on host machine (/home/kevinsupendi96/jenkins in this case), not on persistent disk. If the pod is deleted, all jenkins configuration will be deleted as well
- I use kubenet network plugin (default), that creates new cbr0 bridge when deploying pods. Make sure docker in each node connect to cbr0 bridge
- When configuring Jenkins build executor, use 'jnlp' for container name and pod name
- I use sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock to hack with docker inside docker for jenkins easy configuration :p
- GCE routing module not available in Ansible, must have done it manually in GCP Console 

Notes on Ansible :
- Some condition are not fully automated yet:
  1. etcd.service = etcd servers
  2. apiserver.service =  number of apiserver and etcd servers
  3. kubelet.service = apiservers
- Sometimes cbr0 bridges ips are not configured correctly, creating errors in routing
